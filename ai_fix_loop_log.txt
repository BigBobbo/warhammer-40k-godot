SUMMARY: Fixed critical PhaseManager._set_state_value bug (dict keys treated as array indices) that prevented secondary VP and CP from being applied to GameState. Fixed null weapon stats crash. Added PILE_IN/CONSOLIDATE error recovery. P1 (Custodes) now consistently hits 60+ VP. P2 (Orks) needs improvement — averaging 36 VP, 0-5 secondary VP, losing all characters every game.

SUMMARY: Fixed Ork over-aggression abandoning objectives (3 code paths with 999" chase distance reduced to 12-18" by round). Reduced faction aggression 2.2→1.6. Added New Orders evaluation. Lowered action mission achievability. Added focus charge bonuses. P2 VP improved from avg 38→47, secondary VP from 0-5→5-21. Game 3 was a 1-point game (52-51).

SUMMARY: Fixed Painboss can_lead (now attaches to Boyz with FNP 5+), added charge coordination tracker for gang-up bonuses. Orks won 2 of 4 games (first Ork wins ever). P2 hit 50 primary VP cap. Charge coordination triggered up to 9 pile-ons per game.

SUMMARY: Smart WAAAGH! timing (hold until Round 2 when units in range), REPLACE_SECONDARY_MISSION handling (auto-replace action-based dead cards), secondary kill-target priority (+40% boost for keyword-matched targets), aggressive New Orders thresholds. Record Ork VP of 67 (50 pri + 17 sec). First ever Custodes unit kill (Shield-Captain by Boyz). High variance persists — Ork results swing 25-67 VP based on early character survival.

SUMMARY: Fixed CommandPhase secondary mission snapshot timing (snapshot BEFORE objective check), added dual-leader support to FormationsPhase (20-model Boyz can take 2 leaders with WARBOSS), increased Boyz squads from 17 to 20 models. Result: 4/5 Ork characters now attach to bodyguards (was 2/5), Orks killed 9 Custodes units across 4 games (avg 2.25/game vs 0.25 in session 7 — 9x improvement). Win rate 50/50, 3 of 4 games decided by 1-2 VP.

SUMMARY: Session 14 — Improved objective retention (held_threatened bonus, R2 NML urgency, early objective priority 0.85→0.95, round-scaled on-obj bonus) and dynamic secondary achievability (Area Denial checks enemy center density, A Tempting Target checks actual control). P2 avg 65 VP (best ever), P1 avg 54 VP. 3 of 4 games produced qualifying scores (60+ VP). All 4 games completed without stalls.

SUMMARY: Fixed fallback melee strength bug (toughness→strength), added Custodes faction aggression 1.5, excluded ranged vehicles from melee aggression, added R1 advance-for-charge setup. P1 now gets 2-4 kills per game (was 0 in session 14). Both armies scored qualifying wins (68 VP P1, 67 VP P2). Win rate 2-2 = perfectly balanced.

SUMMARY: Session 16 — Focus fire kill completion improvements (tighter overkill tolerance, softer charge suppression, higher kill bonuses) + secondary VP consistency (realistic achievability for Behind Enemy Lines and Bring it Down, aggressive New Orders swapping, higher secondary movement bonuses). P1 scored 61 VP qualifying win in Game 4. P1 secondary VP dramatically improved (avg 12.3 in games 2-4). P2 competitiveness declined — needs Ork-specific improvements next iteration.
