# PRP: Fix Non-Circular Base Collision Detection in Deployment Phase

## Summary

Fix deployment overlap detection to use accurate shape-to-shape collision instead of bounding circle approximation. Currently, even though the codebase has a comprehensive BaseShape system, the deployment phase falls back to treating all bases as circles for overlap checks, causing false collision positives for non-circular bases like the Caladius grav tank (oval 170mm x 105mm).

## Problem Statement

**Observed Behavior:**
- When deploying models with non-circular bases (e.g., Caladius grav tank with 170mm x 105mm oval base)
- The deployment validation uses bounding circle approximation for overlap detection
- An oval 170mm x 105mm is treated as a 170mm diameter circle
- This causes false positives: models can't be placed where their actual shape would fit

**User Impact:**
- Vehicles with oval/rectangular bases cannot be deployed in valid positions
- Players see "Cannot overlap with existing models" even when actual shapes don't overlap
- Deployment zone space is artificially restricted for non-circular bases

**Example:**
```
Caladius Tank (170mm x 105mm oval):
- Actual bounding box: 170mm x 105mm
- Bounding circle used: 170mm diameter (85mm radius)
- Extra "ghost area": ~38% larger than actual base
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### File: `/Users/robertocallaghan/Documents/claude/godotv2/40k/scripts/DeploymentController.gd`

**Line 692-704: `_shapes_overlap()` function**

```gdscript
func _shapes_overlap(pos1: Vector2, model1: Dictionary, rot1: float,
                     pos2: Vector2, model2: Dictionary, rot2: float) -> bool:
    # Simple distance check for now - can be improved with actual shape collision
    var shape1 = Measurement.create_base_shape(model1)
    var shape2 = Measurement.create_base_shape(model2)

    if not shape1 or not shape2:
        return false

    # For simplicity, use bounding circle check  ❌ THIS IS THE BUG
    var radius1 = _get_bounding_radius(shape1)
    var radius2 = _get_bounding_radius(shape2)

    return pos1.distance_to(pos2) < (radius1 + radius2)
```

**The Problem:**
1. ✅ Correctly creates BaseShape objects for both models
2. ❌ Then throws away the shape data and uses circular approximation
3. The comment even admits: "can be improved with actual shape collision"

**Line 706-713: `_get_bounding_radius()` function**

```gdscript
func _get_bounding_radius(shape: BaseShape) -> float:
    """Calculate bounding circle radius for a shape"""
    var bounds = shape.get_bounds()
    # Use diagonal of bounding box / 2 as radius
    var diagonal = Vector2(bounds.size.x, bounds.size.y).length()
    return diagonal / 2.0
```

For an oval 170mm x 105mm:
- Actual half-axes: 85mm x 52.5mm
- Bounding circle radius: sqrt(85² + 52.5²) / 2 = ~70mm
- This makes the collision area much larger than the actual oval

### Why This Wasn't Fixed Before

Looking at git history:
- Commit `6eff99c`: "Fix non-circular base deployment validation" - Fixed zone validation
- Commit `ed89193`: "Fix circular collision detection for non-circular bases" - Fixed charge/movement
- Commit `92bb458`: "Implement non-circular base shape rendering" - Fixed visual rendering

But the `_shapes_overlap()` function in DeploymentController was left with the TODO comment "can be improved with actual shape collision".

## Existing Infrastructure (Already Working!)

The fix is trivial because the BaseShape system already provides everything we need:

### BaseShape API (40k/scripts/bases/BaseShape.gd)

```gdscript
# This method ALREADY EXISTS and is well-tested
func overlaps_with(other: BaseShape, my_position: Vector2, my_rotation: float,
                   other_position: Vector2, other_rotation: float) -> bool
```

**Implementations:**
- **CircularBase.gd** (lines 60-84): Optimized circle-circle and circle-shape collision
- **OvalBase.gd** (lines 129-203): Ellipse collision using 24-point edge sampling
- **RectangularBase.gd** (lines 129-191): SAT (Separating Axis Theorem) for rectangles

### Measurement API (40k/autoloads/Measurement.gd)

Already has a shape-aware overlap function (lines 112-135):

```gdscript
static func models_overlap(model1: Dictionary, model2: Dictionary) -> bool:
    var shape1 = create_base_shape(model1)
    var shape2 = create_base_shape(model2)

    if not shape1 or not shape2:
        return false

    var pos1 = Vector2(model1.position.x, model1.position.y)
    var pos2 = Vector2(model2.position.x, model2.position.y)
    var rot1 = model1.get("rotation", 0.0)
    var rot2 = model2.get("rotation", 0.0)

    return shape1.overlaps_with(shape2, pos1, rot1, pos2, rot2)
```

This is already used successfully in:
- Movement phase (MovementPhase.gd:1209)
- Charge phase (ChargePhase.gd - after fix ed89193)
- Other controllers

### Test Coverage

**File:** `/Users/robertocallaghan/Documents/claude/godotv2/40k/tests/unit/test_model_overlap.gd`

Existing tests verify shape collision works:
```gdscript
func test_circular_oval_overlap()
func test_rectangular_oval_overlap()
func test_oval_oval_overlap()
```

All passing ✅

**File:** `/Users/robertocallaghan/Documents/claude/godotv2/40k/tests/unit/test_non_circular_deployment.gd`

Tests for deployment shape creation and hit detection (but NOT overlap detection - needs new test).

## Implementation Plan

### Task 1: Replace Bounding Circle with Shape Collision

**File:** `/Users/robertocallaghan/Documents/claude/godotv2/40k/scripts/DeploymentController.gd`

**Location:** Lines 692-704

**Current Code:**
```gdscript
func _shapes_overlap(pos1: Vector2, model1: Dictionary, rot1: float,
                     pos2: Vector2, model2: Dictionary, rot2: float) -> bool:
    # Simple distance check for now - can be improved with actual shape collision
    var shape1 = Measurement.create_base_shape(model1)
    var shape2 = Measurement.create_base_shape(model2)

    if not shape1 or not shape2:
        return false

    # For simplicity, use bounding circle check
    var radius1 = _get_bounding_radius(shape1)
    var radius2 = _get_bounding_radius(shape2)

    return pos1.distance_to(pos2) < (radius1 + radius2)
```

**Updated Code:**
```gdscript
func _shapes_overlap(pos1: Vector2, model1: Dictionary, rot1: float,
                     pos2: Vector2, model2: Dictionary, rot2: float) -> bool:
    # Use actual shape collision detection from BaseShape API
    var shape1 = Measurement.create_base_shape(model1)
    var shape2 = Measurement.create_base_shape(model2)

    if not shape1 or not shape2:
        return false

    # Use shape-aware collision (works for all shape combinations)
    return shape1.overlaps_with(shape2, pos1, rot1, pos2, rot2)
```

**Changes:**
- Remove bounding circle calculation
- Use `shape1.overlaps_with()` API directly
- Remove `_get_bounding_radius()` helper (no longer needed)

### Task 2: Remove Unused `_get_bounding_radius()` Function

**File:** `/Users/robertocallaghan/Documents/claude/godotv2/40k/scripts/DeploymentController.gd`

**Location:** Lines 706-713

**Action:** Delete this function entirely (no longer used anywhere after Task 1)

### Task 3: Add Test for Non-Circular Deployment Overlap

**File:** `/Users/robertocallaghan/Documents/claude/godotv2/40k/tests/unit/test_non_circular_deployment.gd`

**Add new test:**

```gdscript
func test_oval_deployment_no_false_positive_overlap():
    """Test that oval bases don't trigger false overlap with bounding circles"""

    # Create two Caladius models (170mm x 105mm ovals)
    var model1_data = {
        "base_mm": 170,
        "base_type": "oval",
        "base_dimensions": {"length": 170, "width": 105},
        "position": Vector2(0, 0),
        "rotation": 0.0
    }

    var model2_data = {
        "base_mm": 170,
        "base_type": "oval",
        "base_dimensions": {"length": 170, "width": 105},
        "position": Vector2(200, 0),  # 200px apart horizontally
        "rotation": 0.0
    }

    # Models should NOT overlap
    # Bounding circle approach: radius ~85mm each, 200px apart -> MIGHT falsely report overlap
    # Actual shape approach: ovals don't touch -> correctly reports no overlap

    var shape1 = Measurement.create_base_shape(model1_data)
    var shape2 = Measurement.create_base_shape(model2_data)

    var overlaps = shape1.overlaps_with(shape2,
        model1_data.position, model1_data.rotation,
        model2_data.position, model2_data.rotation)

    assert_false(overlaps, "Oval bases 200px apart should not overlap")

func test_caladius_deployment_near_edge():
    """Test that Caladius can deploy near zone edge where bounding circle would fail"""

    # Deployment zone polygon (simplified)
    var zone = PackedVector2Array([
        Vector2(0, 0),
        Vector2(1000, 0),
        Vector2(1000, 500),
        Vector2(0, 500)
    ])

    # Caladius positioned near edge
    # Oval is 170mm x 105mm (~267px x 165px)
    # Position 150px from edge - actual oval fits, bounding circle doesn't
    var caladius_data = {
        "base_mm": 170,
        "base_type": "oval",
        "base_dimensions": {"length": 170, "width": 105},
        "rotation": PI / 2  # Rotated 90 degrees (narrow side toward edge)
    }

    var deployment_controller = DeploymentController.new()
    var position = Vector2(150, 250)  # Near left edge

    # Should be valid with actual shape, invalid with bounding circle
    var is_valid = deployment_controller._shape_wholly_in_polygon(
        position, caladius_data, caladius_data.rotation, zone)

    assert_true(is_valid, "Rotated Caladius should fit 150px from edge")
```

## Validation Gates

### Pre-Implementation Checks

```bash
cd /Users/robertocallaghan/Documents/claude/godotv2

# Verify current behavior uses bounding circle
grep -n "bounding circle" 40k/scripts/DeploymentController.gd

# Check BaseShape API is available
grep -n "overlaps_with" 40k/scripts/bases/BaseShape.gd

# Verify tests exist
ls 40k/tests/unit/test_non_circular_deployment.gd
ls 40k/tests/unit/test_model_overlap.gd
```

### Post-Implementation Validation

```bash
# 1. Syntax check
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
godot --headless --check-only --path /Users/robertocallaghan/Documents/claude/godotv2

# 2. Run deployment tests
godot --headless --path /Users/robertocallaghan/Documents/claude/godotv2 \
      --script res://40k/addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd \
      -gtest=res://40k/tests/unit/test_non_circular_deployment.gd

# 3. Run overlap tests
godot --headless --path /Users/robertocallaghan/Documents/claude/godotv2 \
      --script res://40k/addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd \
      -gtest=res://40k/tests/unit/test_model_overlap.gd

# 4. Integration test - Manual verification
# - Launch game
# - Load Adeptus Custodes army (has Caladius)
# - Enter deployment phase
# - Try deploying Caladius near zone edge in various rotations
# - Verify can place where actual oval fits
# - Verify cannot place where actual oval overlaps
```

### Success Criteria

- [ ] No "bounding circle" comment in code
- [ ] `_shapes_overlap()` uses `shape.overlaps_with()` API
- [ ] `_get_bounding_radius()` function removed
- [ ] New tests added and passing
- [ ] All existing tests still pass
- [ ] Caladius can deploy near edges where oval fits
- [ ] Deployment still prevents actual overlaps

### Codebase Patterns

**Shape Creation Pattern:**
```gdscript
var shape = Measurement.create_base_shape(model_data)
# Returns: CircularBase | OvalBase | RectangularBase
```

**Overlap Check Pattern:**
```gdscript
var overlaps = shape1.overlaps_with(shape2, pos1, rot1, pos2, rot2)
# Returns: bool (true if shapes intersect)
```

**Model Data Structure:**
```gdscript
{
    "base_mm": 170,              # Primary dimension
    "base_type": "oval",         # "circular" | "oval" | "rectangular"
    "base_dimensions": {
        "length": 170,           # Major axis (mm)
        "width": 105             # Minor axis (mm)
    },
    "position": Vector2(...),
    "rotation": 0.0              # Radians
}
```

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Forgetting to Pass Rotation
**Issue:** Shape collision requires rotation parameter
```gdscript
# ❌ Wrong
shape1.overlaps_with(shape2, pos1, pos2)

# ✅ Correct
shape1.overlaps_with(shape2, pos1, rot1, pos2, rot2)
```

### 2. Position vs Model Data
**Issue:** BaseShape expects positions as Vector2, not Dictionary
```gdscript
# ❌ Wrong
shape.overlaps_with(other, model1.position, ...)  # position might be dict

# ✅ Correct
var pos1 = Vector2(model1.position.x, model1.position.y)
shape.overlaps_with(other, pos1, ...)
```

### 3. Null Shape Handling
**Issue:** `create_base_shape()` can return null for malformed data
```gdscript
# ✅ Always check for null
var shape1 = Measurement.create_base_shape(model1)
if not shape1:
    return false  # Safe fallback
```

### 4. Units: MM vs Pixels
**Issue:** Model data uses mm, collision uses pixels
```gdscript
# ✅ BaseShape handles conversion internally
var shape = Measurement.create_base_shape(model_data)  # Converts mm → px
```

## Task Execution Order

1. **Read current `_shapes_overlap()` code** (lines 692-704)
2. **Replace with `shape.overlaps_with()` call** (single line change)
3. **Delete `_get_bounding_radius()` function** (lines 706-713)
4. **Add deployment overlap tests** (test_non_circular_deployment.gd)
5. **Run syntax validation** (godot --check-only)
6. **Run unit tests** (test_non_circular_deployment.gd, test_model_overlap.gd)
7. **Manual integration test** (deploy Caladius near edges)

## Related Issues and PRPs

- **gh_issue_104_non-circular-base-deployment.md**: Fixed zone validation and formations (partial fix)
- **gh_issue_91_base-shape-issue.md**: Fixed visual rendering
- **gh_issue_base_shape_collision_fix.md**: Fixed charge and movement phases
- This PRP: Completes the deployment phase fix by replacing bounding circle overlap

## Expected Outcome

### Before Fix:
```
Deploying Caladius (170mm x 105mm oval):
- Treated as 170mm diameter circle
- Cannot place 100px from edge (bounding circle extends beyond)
- Cannot place 200px from another Caladius (bounding circles overlap)
```

### After Fix:
```
Deploying Caladius (170mm x 105mm oval):
- Uses actual 170mm x 105mm oval shape
- CAN place 100px from edge if oval fits (especially when rotated)
- CAN place closer to other Caladius if actual ovals don't touch
- Still prevents actual overlaps correctly
```
