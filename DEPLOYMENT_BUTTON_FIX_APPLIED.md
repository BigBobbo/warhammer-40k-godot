# Deployment Button Fix - APPLIED ✓

## Root Cause Identified

From analyzing your log file `debug_20251009_094244.log`, I found the problem:

### The Issue
```
"button_text":"End Phase"  ← WRONG! Should be "End Deployment"
```

The button text was never set correctly because **`update_ui_for_phase()` was NEVER called during game startup**.

### Why This Happened

In `Main.gd`, the `_ready()` function does this:

1. ✅ Calls `phase_manager.transition_to_phase(DEPLOYMENT)` (line 82)
2. ✅ Calls `setup_phase_controllers()` (line 125)
3. ✅ Calls `connect_signals()` (line 127)
4. ✅ Calls `update_ui()` (line 129)
5. ❌ **NEVER calls `update_ui_for_phase()`** ← THE BUG!

Without `update_ui_for_phase()`:
- Button text stays as "End Phase" (default from scene file)
- Signal handler is NEVER connected
- Clicking the button does nothing

### The Signal Connection Problem

The `_on_phase_changed` signal handler (which calls `update_ui_for_phase`) is only triggered when the phase CHANGES. But on initial game load:
1. PhaseManager sets the phase to DEPLOYMENT
2. But no signal is emitted because it's the first phase
3. So Main never knows to configure the UI

## The Fix

Added ONE line to `Main.gd` line 134:

```gdscript
connect_signals()
refresh_unit_list()
update_ui()

# CRITICAL FIX: Must call update_ui_for_phase() to properly configure the phase action button
update_ui_for_phase()  ← NEW LINE

# Enable autosave...
```

This ensures:
1. ✅ Button text is set to "End Deployment"
2. ✅ Signal handler is connected
3. ✅ Button becomes enabled when all units deployed
4. ✅ Clicking the button triggers phase transition

## Testing Instructions

1. **Launch the game:**
   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH" && godot
   ```

2. **Deploy all units**

3. **Click "End Deployment"** (button text should now be correct!)

4. **Verify it works:**
   - Button should say "End Deployment" (not "End Phase")
   - Button should be disabled until all units deployed
   - Button should become enabled when last unit is placed
   - Clicking should transition to Command Phase

## Expected Log Output

After the fix, you should see in the logs:

```
Main: ⚠️ Calling update_ui_for_phase() for initial phase setup
Main: ========== UPDATE UI FOR PHASE ==========
Main: Current phase: DEPLOYMENT
Main: Phase button configured - text: 'End Deployment' visible: true disabled: true
Main: ⚠️ VERIFICATION - Button connected: true
Main: ⚠️ Initial phase UI setup complete
```

Then after deploying all units and clicking:

```
Main: ⚠️⚠️⚠️ BUTTON WAS ACTUALLY CLICKED ⚠️⚠️⚠️
Main: ⚠️ Calling NetworkIntegration.route_action with action: {type:END_DEPLOYMENT}
DeploymentPhase: ⚠️⚠️⚠️ _process_end_deployment CALLED ⚠️⚠️⚠️
DeploymentPhase: ⚠️ Emitting phase_completed signal
```

## Verification Command

After testing, check the logs:

```bash
cd "/Users/robertocallaghan/Library/Application Support/Godot/app_userdata/40k/logs/"
python3 << 'EOF'
import glob
import os

# Get latest log
logs = glob.glob('debug_*.log')
latest = max(logs, key=os.path.getctime)

print(f"Checking: {latest}\n")

with open(latest, 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        if any(x in line for x in ['Initial phase UI setup', 'button_text', 'End Deployment', 'BUTTON WAS ACTUALLY CLICKED']):
            print(line.rstrip())
EOF
```

## If It Still Doesn't Work

If the button still doesn't work after this fix, the logs will show:
1. Whether `update_ui_for_phase()` was called
2. Whether the button text is correct
3. Whether the signal is connected
4. Whether the click is registered

Share the log output and we'll investigate further.

## Files Modified

- `40k/scripts/Main.gd` (line 134) - Added call to `update_ui_for_phase()`
- `40k/scripts/Main.gd` (line 1812-1831) - Enhanced logging for network routing
- `40k/phases/DeploymentPhase.gd` (line 255-269) - Enhanced logging for phase completion
