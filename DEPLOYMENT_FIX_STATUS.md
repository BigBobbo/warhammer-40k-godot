# Deployment Button Fix - Status Update

## What We Found

✅ **Good News**: The button IS being clicked and the handler IS being called!

From your logs (`debug_20251008_212048.log`), I can see:

```
[2025-10-08 21:21:13] Phase action button pressed
[2025-10-08 21:21:13] _on_end_deployment_pressed called
[2025-10-08 21:21:13] Ending deployment phase
```

The button works! The issue is that **the phase transition is not completing**.

## Root Cause

The action flow is:
1. ✅ Button clicked → `_on_phase_action_pressed()`
2. ✅ Calls → `_on_end_deployment_pressed()`
3. ✅ Creates action → `{"type": "END_DEPLOYMENT"}`
4. ⚠️ Routes to → `NetworkIntegration.route_action(action)`
5. ❓ **This is where the logs stop** - Something is failing in the network routing

## Enhanced Logging Added

I've added comprehensive logging to track exactly what happens:

### In Main.gd (`_on_end_deployment_pressed`):
- Logs when NetworkIntegration.route_action is called
- Logs the action being sent
- Logs the result returned
- Logs if it fails with error details

### In DeploymentPhase.gd (`_process_end_deployment`):
- Logs when the function is called
- Logs when phase_completed signal is emitted
- Logs the return result

## Next Steps - Please Test Again

1. **Run the game again:**
   ```bash
   # Just launch Godot normally
   export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH" && godot
   ```

2. **Deploy all units and click "End Deployment"**

3. **Check the latest log:**
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/robertocallaghan/Library/Application Support/Godot/app_userdata/40k/logs/"
   ls -t | head -1  # Shows latest log filename

   # View the relevant parts:
   python3 -c "
   import sys
   with open(sys.argv[1], 'r') as f:
       lines = f.readlines()
       for line in lines:
           if any(x in line for x in ['⚠️', 'END_DEPLOYMENT', 'NetworkIntegration', 'route_action', 'phase_completed']):
               print(line.rstrip())
   " debug_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log  # Replace with actual filename
   ```

## What to Look For

The new logs will show:

1. **If NetworkIntegration is called:**
   ```
   Main: ⚠️ Calling NetworkIntegration.route_action with action: {type:END_DEPLOYMENT}
   ```

2. **What it returns:**
   ```
   Main: ⚠️ NetworkIntegration.route_action returned: {result_dict}
   ```

3. **If the action reaches DeploymentPhase:**
   ```
   DeploymentPhase: ⚠️⚠️⚠️ _process_end_deployment CALLED ⚠️⚠️⚠️
   ```

4. **If the signal is emitted:**
   ```
   DeploymentPhase: ⚠️ Emitting phase_completed signal
   DeploymentPhase: ⚠️ phase_completed signal emitted
   ```

## Expected Outcomes

### If NetworkIntegration Returns an Error:
You'll see:
```
Main: ⚠️ End-phase action FAILED: [error message]
```
**Fix**: We'll need to investigate why the network routing is failing

### If DeploymentPhase is Not Called:
You won't see:
```
DeploymentPhase: ⚠️⚠️⚠️ _process_end_deployment CALLED
```
**Fix**: The action routing logic needs to be corrected

### If Signal is Not Connected:
You'll see the signal emitted but no phase change
**Fix**: Need to ensure phase_completed signal is properly connected

## Quick Manual Test

If you want to test if the phase logic works manually, you can:

1. Open Godot
2. Deploy all units
3. Press ` (backtick) to open console
4. Type: `get_node("/root/PhaseManager").advance_to_next_phase()`
5. Press Enter

If this works, it confirms the issue is in the action routing, not the phase manager.

## Files Modified

1. `40k/scripts/Main.gd` - Added detailed routing logs
2. `40k/phases/DeploymentPhase.gd` - Added process logs

All changes are logging only - no functionality changed.
