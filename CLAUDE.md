Do not remove debugging logs unless specifically asked to do so.

If godot is not running in the command line run export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH" and try again.

The debug output of godot is being piped to files in the format /Users/.../Library/Application Support/Godot/app_userdata/40k/logs/debug_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log
As the godot output is not always reachable, ensure that all logging is also saved to this file.
