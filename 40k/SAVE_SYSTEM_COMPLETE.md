## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Quick Test (5 minutes)

1. **Start the game**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/robertocallaghan/Documents/claude/godotv2/40k
   godot
   ```

2. **Set up a battle**
   - Load a save with two opposing armies OR start a new game
   - Deploy units from both armies

3. **Enter Shooting Phase**
   - Click "Next Phase" until you reach shooting phase

4. **Execute a shooting attack**
   - Select a shooter unit from the right panel
   - Select a weapon from the weapon tree
   - Click an enemy unit to assign target (or use auto-assign button)
   - Click "Confirm Targets"

5. **Verify SaveDialog Appears**
   - Dialog should pop up showing:
     - Attacker and weapon info
     - Save statistics
     - Model allocation grid
   - Console should show: "ShootingController: SaveDialog shown for [unit name]"

6. **Roll Saves**
   - Click "Roll All Saves" button
   - Dice log should fill with save results (green for pass, red for fail)

7. **Apply Damage**
   - Click "Apply Damage" button
   - Dialog should close
   - Target unit should have damage applied (check model HP/casualties)
   - Shooting should continue normally

### Expected Console Output

```
ShootingPhase: Attack rolls complete
ShootingPhase: Awaiting defender to make saves...
ShootingController: Saves required for 1 targets
ShootingController: SaveDialog shown for Ork Boyz
SaveDialog initialized
[SaveDialog displays]
[User clicks "Roll All Saves"]
[User clicks "Apply Damage"]
ShootingPhase: Ork Boyz: 3 saves passed, 2 failed ‚Üí 2 casualties
ShootingPhase: Save resolution complete - 2 total casualties
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Data Flow

```
1. Attacker Shoots
   ‚îî‚îÄ> ShootingPhase._process_resolve_shooting()
       ‚îî‚îÄ> RulesEngine.resolve_shoot_until_wounds()
           ‚îî‚îÄ> Returns save_data_list
           ‚îî‚îÄ> ShootingPhase emits saves_required signal

2. Dialog Shown
   ‚îî‚îÄ> ShootingController._on_saves_required()
       ‚îî‚îÄ> Creates SaveDialog
       ‚îî‚îÄ> SaveDialog.setup(save_data)
       ‚îî‚îÄ> Dialog shown to user

3. User Rolls Saves
   ‚îî‚îÄ> SaveDialog._on_roll_saves_pressed()
       ‚îî‚îÄ> RulesEngine.roll_saves_batch()
       ‚îî‚îÄ> Results displayed in dice log

4. User Applies Damage
   ‚îî‚îÄ> SaveDialog._on_apply_damage_pressed()
       ‚îî‚îÄ> Creates APPLY_SAVES action
       ‚îî‚îÄ> NetworkManager.submit_action()
           ‚îî‚îÄ> ShootingPhase._process_apply_saves()
               ‚îî‚îÄ> RulesEngine.apply_save_damage()
               ‚îî‚îÄ> Diffs applied to GameState
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Self-Contained Dialog** - SaveDialog submits actions directly (simplified integration)
2. **Auto-Allocation Only** - Manual allocation deferred to Phase 2
3. **Batch Rolling** - All saves at once for speed
4. **Action-Based** - All state changes go through validated actions (multiplayer-ready)
5. **Signal-Driven** - Loose coupling between phase and UI

---

## üêõ Known Limitations (Phase 1)

1. **Single Target** - Only handles one target unit at a time
2. **No Manual Allocation** - Defender can't choose model allocation
3. **No Re-Rolls** - Command re-rolls not implemented
4. **No FNP** - Feel No Pain rolls not implemented
5. **No Cover Indicators** - Cover calculated but not visually shown
6. **Multiplayer Untested** - Network sync needs verification

These are ALL planned for Phase 2 & 3!

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Dialog Doesn't Appear

**Check:**
1. Console for "saves_required" signal emission
2. Console for "SaveDialog shown for..." message
3. That wounds were actually caused (check dice log for wound rolls > 0)

**Fix:**
- Verify ShootingController line 296-298 has the signal connection
- Check ShootingPhase line 356 emits the signal

### Action Fails

**Check:**
1. Console for "APPLY_SAVES" action validation errors
2. NetworkManager receives the action
3. ShootingPhase._process_apply_saves() is called

**Fix:**
- Verify SaveDialog line 284-294 creates the action correctly
- Check ShootingPhase line 688-697 validates properly

### Damage Not Applied

**Check:**
1. RulesEngine.apply_save_damage() is called
2. Diffs are returned from the function
3. Diffs are applied to GameState

**Fix:**
- Check console for save results
- Verify model indices are correct
- Check GameState snapshot is current

---

## üìà Performance Notes

- SaveDialog is lightweight (~300 lines, minimal UI)
- RulesEngine functions are pure/stateless (no side effects)
- Auto-allocation is O(n) where n = model count
- Batch rolling is single RNG call per wound
- Network traffic: 2 messages (hit/wound dice, save result)

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate (Testing)
1. ‚úÖ Implementation complete
2. ‚è≥ Test single-player save flow (YOU ARE HERE)
3. ‚è≥ Fix any bugs found
4. ‚è≥ Test multiplayer save flow
5. ‚è≥ Mark Phase 1 complete in PRP

### Future (Phase 2 - Enhanced)
- Manual wound allocation UI with drag-and-drop
- Individual save control (roll one at a time)
- Command re-rolls with CP tracking
- Visual health bars with animations
- Cover indicators on model grid

### Future (Phase 3 - Complete)

- Feel No Pain rolls
- Stratagem integration
- Mortal wound special handling
- Damage spillover for multi-wound weapons

## üéì Learning Points

### What Worked Well
1. **Signal-Based Architecture** - Clean separation of concerns
2. **RulesEngine Purity** - Easy to test and reason about
3. **Action System** - Multiplayer support "for free"
4. **Incremental Implementation** - Phase 1 foundation solid

### Challenges Overcome
1. **State Management** - Needed `pending_save_data` to bridge phases
2. **Signal Timing** - Dialog must wait for wound rolls to complete
3. **Model Indexing** - Required careful tracking of model indices
4. **Allocation Rules** - 10e wounded-first rule correctly implemented
