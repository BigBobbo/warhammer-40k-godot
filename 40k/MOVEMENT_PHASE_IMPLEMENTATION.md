# Movement Phase Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete Movement Phase for the Warhammer 40k 10th Edition game in Godot 4.4, following the detailed PRP requirements.

## Implementation Components

### 1. Core Movement Logic (`phases/MovementPhase.gd`)
- **Full 10e rules implementation** with all four movement types:
  - Normal Move (M inches)
  - Advance (M + D6 inches, cannot shoot/charge)
  - Fall Back (M inches from engagement, cannot shoot/charge)
  - Remain Stationary
  
- **Key Features:**
  - Engagement range validation (1" standard)
  - Movement cap enforcement
  - Terrain collision detection
  - Desperate Escape rolls for Fall Back
  - Battle-shocked unit handling
  - Path validation and tracking

### 2. Movement Controller (`scripts/MovementController.gd`)
- **UI interaction handler** for the movement phase
- **Features:**
  - Model dragging with visual feedback
  - Path visualization (green for valid, red for invalid)
  - Ruler display for distance measurement
  - Ghost preview for model placement
  - Grid snapping (0.5" increments with Ctrl)
  - Movement HUD with cap/used/remaining display
  - Dice log for Advance and Desperate Escape rolls

### 3. Measurement Utilities (`autoloads/Measurement.gd`)
- **Enhanced measurement functions:**
  - `distance_polyline_px()` - Calculate path distances
  - `distance_polyline_inches()` - Path distance in game inches
  - `edge_to_edge_distance_px()` - Model base edge calculations
  - `edge_to_edge_distance_inches()` - Edge distance in inches

### 4. Main UI Integration (`scripts/Main.gd`)
- **Phase management integration:**
  - Automatic controller switching between phases
  - Phase-specific UI updates
  - Movement action request handling
  - Phase transition management

### 5. Test Suite (`tests/MovementPhaseTest.gd`)
- **Comprehensive validation tests:**
  - Normal movement validation
  - Advance with dice rolls
  - Fall Back from engagement
  - Engagement range rules
  - Terrain collision detection
  - Desperate Escape mechanics
  - Movement restrictions (cannot shoot/charge)
  - Action validation edge cases

## Actions & Results System

### Movement Actions
```gdscript
BEGIN_NORMAL_MOVE    # Start standard movement
BEGIN_ADVANCE        # Start advance (rolls D6)
BEGIN_FALL_BACK      # Start fall back from engagement
SET_MODEL_DEST       # Place a model at destination
UNDO_LAST_MODEL_MOVE # Undo the last model placement
RESET_UNIT_MOVE      # Reset all models in unit
CONFIRM_UNIT_MOVE    # Finalize the unit's movement
REMAIN_STATIONARY    # Mark unit as not moving
```

### Result Structure
Each action produces a deterministic result with:
- State changes (diffs)
- Dice rolls (for replay)
- Success/failure status
- Error messages for validation failures

## Validation Rules Implemented

### Movement Caps
- Normal Move: M inches (unit stat)
- Advance: M + D6 inches
- Fall Back: M inches

### Engagement Range (1")
- Normal/Advance cannot enter or end in ER
- Fall Back can move through ER but must end outside
- Units starting in ER can only Fall Back or Remain Stationary

### Terrain
- Impassable terrain blocks movement
- Model base radius considered for collision
- MVP uses simplified rectangle bounds checking

### Desperate Escape
- Triggered when Fall Back crosses enemy models
- Roll D6 per affected model (or all if Battle-shocked)
- On 1-2: One model destroyed (player chooses)

## UI/UX Features

### Visual Feedback
- Path visualization with color coding
- Ghost preview for model placement
- Ruler showing direct distance
- Movement cap display in HUD
- Unit status indicators

### Controls
- Click model to start dragging
- Drag to place at destination
- Ctrl+drag for grid snapping
- Undo/Reset/Confirm buttons
- Unit list with movement status

### Dice Log
- Advance rolls displayed with results
- Desperate Escape outcomes tracked
- Persistent log for the phase

## Integration Points

### Phase Manager
- Seamless transition from Deployment to Movement
- Phase completion signaling
- State snapshot management

### Game State
- Unit flags tracking (moved, advanced, fell_back)
- Movement restrictions for later phases
- Model position updates

### Save/Load System
- Movement state preserved in saves
- Active moves cleared on phase exit
- Dice log maintained for replay

## Testing & Validation

### Test Coverage
- ✅ All movement types functional
- ✅ Validation rules enforced
- ✅ Dice mechanics working
- ✅ UI interactions responsive
- ✅ Phase transitions smooth
- ✅ Edge cases handled

### Known Limitations (MVP)
- Coherency enforcement (UI helper only)
- FLY keyword not implemented
- Difficult terrain not implemented
- Vertical movement simplified
- Transport embarking/disembarking not included

## Usage Instructions

### For Players
1. Select a unit from the right panel
2. Choose movement type (Normal/Advance/Fall Back)
3. Click and drag models to new positions
4. Use Undo to revert last model
5. Confirm when all models placed
6. End Movement Phase when all units moved

### For Developers
```gdscript
# Access movement phase
var phase = PhaseManager.get_current_phase_instance()

# Execute movement action
var action = {
    "type": "BEGIN_ADVANCE",
    "actor_unit_id": "unit_id",
    "payload": {}
}
var result = phase.execute_action(action)

# Check available actions
var actions = phase.get_available_actions()
```

## Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `/phases/MovementPhase.gd` - Core movement logic
- `/scripts/MovementController.gd` - UI controller
- `/tests/MovementPhaseTest.gd` - Test suite
- `/test_movement.gd` - Test runner

### Modified
- `/autoloads/Measurement.gd` - Added path distance functions
- `/scripts/Main.gd` - Integrated movement phase UI

## Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements
1. Add coherency checking UI helpers
2. Implement FLY keyword support
3. Add difficult terrain penalties
4. Support true vertical movement
5. Add transport rules
6. Enhance path visualization with waypoints
7. Add movement templates for common formations

### Phase Dependencies
The Movement Phase properly sets flags that affect:
- **Shooting Phase**: Units that Advanced/Fell Back cannot shoot
- **Charge Phase**: Units that Advanced/Fell Back cannot charge
- **Fight Phase**: Movement positions determine combat eligibility

## Conclusion

The Movement Phase has been successfully implemented according to the PRP specifications, providing a solid foundation for the Warhammer 40k 10th Edition game. The modular design ensures it integrates seamlessly with existing phases while maintaining independence for future updates.
