# WH40K Game Audit — 2026-05

**Started:** 2026-05-03
**Method:** MCP-driven live-game validation against Wahapedia 10e core rules + faction quirks
**Armies:** Adeptus Custodes (Shield Host) vs Orks (War Horde) — default rosters in `40k/armies/`
**Deployment:** Crucible of Battle
**Terrain:** layout_2

## Status

| Tier | Status | Issues filed |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 0 — Infrastructure | ✅ done | #329 |
| 1 — Phase architecture | ⚠️ done with caveats | #330, #331, #332, #333 |
| 2 — Per-phase rules | not started | — |
| 3 — Unit abilities | not started | — |
| 4 — Cross-phase edge cases | not started | — |
| 5 — Save/load round-trips | not started | — |

## Baseline

- **Pregame baseline:** `40k/saves/audit_baseline_pregame.w40ksave` (123 KB) — Round 1 FORMATIONS, 26 units (9 Custodes + 17 Orks), no formations declared, all UNDEPLOYED
- **Post-deployment baseline:** *deferred — blocked by issue #331 until DeploymentPhase auto-complete is fixed; will rebuild once that's in*

To restore pregame baseline programmatically:
```
get_node('/root/GameState').initialize_default_state('crucible_of_battle')
get_node('/root/PhaseManager').set('game_ended', false)  # workaround for #330
get_node('/root/PhaseManager').transition_to_phase(0)
```

## RNG / Determinism — issue #329

Single-player dice rolls are non-deterministic:
- Only `MovementPhase.gd:1381` honors `payload.rng_seed`
- Charge / Shooting / Fight / Command / RollOff phases ignore the seed
- 8 direct `randi()` bypasses + 3 stratagems + 2 abilities also non-deterministic

Until #329 is patched, dice tests use **multi-trial sampling** for distribution checks; tests requiring exact outcomes are deferred with status `needs-determinism`.

## Tier 0 — Infrastructure

| ID | Item | Status | Notes |
|----|------|--------|-------|
| t0.a | RNG seed passthrough audit | done | Issue #329 filed; only MovementPhase honors `payload.rng_seed` |
| t0.b | Audit baseline save | done | Pregame baseline written; post-deploy deferred until #331 fixed |
| t0.c | Audit log structure | done | This file + per-tier sections |

## Tier 1 — Phase architecture

### t1.a — Phase ordering matches WH40K core
| Aspect | Method | Result |
|---|---|---|
| In-turn order (Cmd→Mvt→Sht→Chg→Fgt→Sco) | code review of `PhaseManager._get_next_phase()` + log replay from prior session | ✅ matches Wahapedia |
| Pre-game order (Formations→Deployment→Redeployment→RollOff→Scout→Command) | code review + live walk from FORMATIONS to ROLL_OFF | ⚠️ runs but DEPLOYMENT/REDEPLOYMENT silently skip — issue #331 |
| SCOUT fires only once per game | code review (no path returns SCOUT after first run) | ✅ correct |
| `MoralePhase` not in active flow | enum still present, but `_get_next_phase` only returns MORALE→DEPLOYMENT (dead) | ⚠️ deadcode — issue #332 |
| `SCOUT_MOVES` reachability | enum present, registered, but no caller returns SCOUT_MOVES | ⚠️ orphan — issue #332 |

### t1.b — END_PHASE idempotency (regression on issue #322)
| Aspect | Method | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `END_<PrevPhase>` accepted as no-op by successor phases | code review of PR #326 (Movement, Shooting, Charge, Fight, Scoring, Command) + prior-session integration test | ✅ in place; deferred re-verification on baseline since live test would require routing through #331 |

### t1.c — Round 5 game-end (regression on issue #319)
| Aspect | Method | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Game ends at P2's END_SCORING in Round 5 | code review of PR #328 (`MAX_BATTLE_ROUNDS`, `_handle_game_end_turn`, `_determine_vp_winner`) + prior-session live verification | ✅ in place |
| `meta.game_ended` and `meta.winner` set | prior-session test result confirmed | ✅ |
| ⚠️ side-effect: `PhaseManager.game_ended` is sticky | discovered during this audit | ❌ filed as #330 |

### t1.d — AUTO_PHASE_ADVANCE timing
| Aspect | Method | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Phases emit `phase_completed` only when complete | code review | ⚠️ DeploymentPhase fires it on enter when `_all_units_deployed()` returns true; that check returns true vacuously when all 26 units are still UNDEPLOYED — issue #331 |
| Live trigger only on action exhaustion | live test (FORMATIONS→ROLL_OFF skip) | ❌ FAIL — see #331 |

### t1.e — Special-phase gating
| Aspect | Method | Result |
|---|---|---|
| FORMATIONS only at game start | `PhaseManager` initial transition is the only entry; no `_get_next_phase` returns it | ✅ |
| ROLL_OFF only between REDEPLOYMENT and SCOUT | `_get_next_phase`: REDEPLOYMENT→ROLL_OFF, ROLL_OFF→SCOUT — never returned again | ✅ |
| SCOUT only before first COMMAND | `_get_next_phase`: ROLL_OFF→SCOUT, SCOUT→COMMAND — never returned again | ✅ |
| REDEPLOYMENT runs unconditionally | `_get_next_phase`: DEPLOYMENT→REDEPLOYMENT every game | ⚠️ design question — per 10e, redeployment is detachment-conditional; not a bug per-se but worth flagging |

## Issues filed during Tier 0+1

| # | Title | Severity | Tier |
|---|-------|----------|------|
| [#329](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/329) | Single-player RNG non-deterministic — `payload.rng_seed` only honored by MovementPhase | High | 0 |
| [#330](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/330) | `PhaseManager.game_ended` is sticky across new games | Medium | 1 |
| [#331](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/331) | DEPLOYMENT phase auto-completes when entered — units never deployed | **Critical** | 1 |
| [#332](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/332) | SCOUT_MOVES orphan + MORALE→DEPLOYMENT dead/wrong fallback | Low | 1 |
| [#333](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/333) | MCP bridge `call_node_method` silently fails when args provided | Medium | 0 |

## Recommendations before Tier 2

1. ~~**Fix #331 first**~~ ✅ **FIXED** in branch `claude/audit-fix-cascade-and-game-ended` — root cause was a cascade: `BasePhase.execute_action` re-checks `_should_complete_phase()` after `process_action` returns, even if the action already emitted `phase_completed`. The signal then fires on the now-defunct phase whose connection is still wired to PhaseManager, causing PhaseManager to advance the *current* phase (which is the next one). Fix: guard the post-action check with `if pm.current_phase_instance == self`. Verified: `CONFIRM_FORMATIONS` for both players now correctly lands in DEPLOYMENT and stays.
2. ~~**Patch #330** alongside~~ ✅ **FIXED** in same branch — `PhaseManager.transition_to_phase(FORMATIONS)` now clears `game_ended`. Verified: after manually setting `game_ended=true`, transition to FORMATIONS clears it.
3. **Patch #329** before Tier 3 (unit abilities) — abilities trigger off dice; testing them properly needs determinism.
4. **#333** is convenience only — `execute_script` workaround is acceptable for the audit.
5. **#332** is cleanup — defer indefinitely.

## Tier 2+ blocker map

| Tier | Blocker | Workaround |
|------|---------|------------|
| 2 (per-phase rules) | #331 (can't reach deployed state scripted) | Build post-deploy save by hand from a UI-driven game, then load |
| 3 (unit abilities) | #329 (dice non-deterministic) | Multi-trial sampling for distribution; defer exact-outcome tests |
| 4 (edge cases) | #331, #329 | Same as above |
| 5 (save/load round-trips) | #330 (game_ended sticky may corrupt saves taken after game-end) | Verify save → reload → state is clean before proceeding |

## Tier 2 — Per-phase rules correctness

### Deployment Phase (in progress)

| ID | Rule | Method | Expected | Observed | Status | Issue |
|----|------|--------|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| t2.d1 | P1/P2 alternation on successful deploy | Deploy Shield-Captain, check `active_player` flip | 1 → 2 | 1 → 2 ✓ | pass | — |
| t2.d2a | Single-model out of zone rejected | DEPLOY_UNIT with center outside polygon | Validation fails, state unchanged, alternation does not flip | Rejected with "Model must be wholly within deployment zone"; status=UNDEPLOYED; active_player unchanged ✓ | pass | — |
| t2.d2b | Multi-model with one out-of-zone rejected | Witchseekers ×4, model 4 mid-board | Whole-action rejected, no per-model partial deploy | Rejected; all models stay UNDEPLOYED ✓ | pass | — |
| t2.d3 | 9" enemy distance rule | Crucible zones too far apart (≥32") to test in-zone; rule is auto-enforced | N/A in Crucible standard deploy | structurally untestable here | skip | — |
| t2.d4 | Unit coherency on initial deploy | Witchseekers ×4 with model 4 at 7" from siblings | Validation fails | **Deployment succeeded** — coherency not enforced | **fail** | [#335](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/335) |
| t2.d5 | Strategic Reserves placement | (deferred — needs formations restart with reserves declared) | — | — | deferred | — |
| t2.d6 | Post-deploy baseline save | Deploy all 26 units, save | full save | partial — to follow-up session | deferred | — |

### Findings
- [#335](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/335) — `DeploymentPhase._validate_deploy_unit_action()` only validates fields, ownership, and per-model zone containment. The 2" coherency rule (enforced in Movement / Charge / Fight) is missing from deployment. Models can be deployed at any distance and the unit ends up `status: DEPLOYED`. Bug surfaces silently — UI normally gates positions visually so this only manifests via scripted/save-edited deployments.
- 9" enemy distance rule cannot be exercised in Crucible of Battle (zones don't overlap, are >32" apart at narrowest). Defer testing until Reserves-arrival or Infiltrator audit, where the rule actually fires.

### Pending Tier 2 work
- Strategic Reserves placement (t2.d5)
- Post-deployment baseline save (t2.d6)
- Phases not yet started: Movement, Shooting, Charge, Fight, Command, Scoring

## Out of scope (this audit)

- Multiplayer / NetworkManager sync (Tier 6 deferred)
- Replay system
- Mathhammer prediction UI (FightPhase.gd:1847 uses random seed but doesn't affect gameplay)
