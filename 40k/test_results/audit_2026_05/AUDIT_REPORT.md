## Final tally

- **15 audit-discovered issues** filed (#319, #320, #321, #322, #323, #329, #330, #331, #332, #333, #335, #336, #337, #338, #339)
- **All 15 closed** via 12 PRs: #324, #325, #326, #327, #328, #334, #340, #341, #342, #343, #344, #345, #346, #347, #348
- **~60 distinct test cases** covered across all in-scope tiers (~46 pass, 6 originally fail then fixed, ~8 deferred)
- **27+ commits** on PR #334 covering audit infrastructure → fixes → Tier 0-5 findings → AUDIT_REPORT.md updates
- All fixes verified live in fresh game post-merge except #337 BGNT (code-only, no engagement-distance setup), #346 partial RNG plumbing (already covered by #348), and #348 full RNG plumbing (game still functions; determinism property not tested via multi-run save/restore)

## Notable working features verified

- **Phase machinery** — alternation, transitions, fights_first, fall-back wiring, mandatory consolidation FAQ, END_<predecessor> idempotency, Round-5 game-end
- **Detachment rules** — Custodes Martial Mastery (round-locked) + Martial Ka'tah (per-fight) + Custodian Guard's Sentinel Storm; Orks War Horde "Get Stuck In" (Sustained Hits 1 on all melee)
- **Once-per-battle abilities** — Orks Waaagh!, Plant Waaagh Banner, both correctly locked
- **Stratagems** — CP cost deduction, effect application (Go to Ground invuln+cover), reactive timing windows (Go to Ground after target select, Tank Shock after vehicle charge, Heroic Intervention end-of-charge, Fire Overwatch on charge declaration, Counter-Offensive after fighter, Epic Challenge on melee selection), USE_NEW_ORDERS/DISCARD_SECONDARY for Crucible mission management
- **Weapon keywords** — Twin-linked re-roll, Sustained Hits (Get Stuck In injection), BLAST (engagement-of-friendlies block), HAZARDOUS (post-attack 1s check)
- **Movement** — base move cap with measured/cap error, Advance D6 with Command Re-roll integration, Strategic Reserves edge+9" rules, engaged unit Fall Back / Remain Stationary restriction, coherency on CONFIRM
- **Battle-shock** — auto-detected on below-half-strength units, 2D6 vs Ld test, auto-resolves at end of Command phase
- **Save/load** — `state.units`, `state.players`, `state.meta`, unit flags all round-trip correctly

## Baseline

- **Pregame baseline:** `40k/saves/audit_baseline_pregame.w40ksave` (123 KB) — Round 1 FORMATIONS, 26 units (9 Custodes + 17 Orks), no formations declared, all UNDEPLOYED
- **Post-deployment baseline:** *deferred — blocked by issue #331 until DeploymentPhase auto-complete is fixed; will rebuild once that's in*

To restore pregame baseline programmatically:
```
get_node('/root/GameState').initialize_default_state('crucible_of_battle')
get_node('/root/PhaseManager').set('game_ended', false)  # workaround for #330
get_node('/root/PhaseManager').transition_to_phase(0)
```

## RNG / Determinism — issue #329

Single-player dice rolls are non-deterministic:
- Only `MovementPhase.gd:1381` honors `payload.rng_seed`
- Charge / Shooting / Fight / Command / RollOff phases ignore the seed
- 8 direct `randi()` bypasses + 3 stratagems + 2 abilities also non-deterministic

Until #329 is patched, dice tests use **multi-trial sampling** for distribution checks; tests requiring exact outcomes are deferred with status `needs-determinism`.

## Tier 0 — Infrastructure

| ID | Item | Status | Notes |
|----|------|--------|-------|
| t0.a | RNG seed passthrough audit | done | Issue #329 filed; only MovementPhase honors `payload.rng_seed` |
| t0.b | Audit baseline save | done | Pregame baseline written; post-deploy deferred until #331 fixed |
| t0.c | Audit log structure | done | This file + per-tier sections |

---

## Tier 1 — Phase architecture

### t1.a — Phase ordering matches WH40K core
| Aspect | Method | Result |
|---|---|---|
| In-turn order (Cmd→Mvt→Sht→Chg→Fgt→Sco) | code review of `PhaseManager._get_next_phase()` + log replay from prior session | ✅ matches Wahapedia |
| Pre-game order (Formations→Deployment→Redeployment→RollOff→Scout→Command) | code review + live walk from FORMATIONS to ROLL_OFF | ⚠️ runs but DEPLOYMENT/REDEPLOYMENT silently skip — issue #331 |
| SCOUT fires only once per game | code review (no path returns SCOUT after first run) | ✅ correct |
| `MoralePhase` not in active flow | enum still present, but `_get_next_phase` only returns MORALE→DEPLOYMENT (dead) | ⚠️ deadcode — issue #332 |
| `SCOUT_MOVES` reachability | enum present, registered, but no caller returns SCOUT_MOVES | ⚠️ orphan — issue #332 |

### t1.b — END_PHASE idempotency (regression on issue #322)
| Aspect | Method | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `END_<PrevPhase>` accepted as no-op by successor phases | code review of PR #326 (Movement, Shooting, Charge, Fight, Scoring, Command) + prior-session integration test | ✅ in place; deferred re-verification on baseline since live test would require routing through #331 |

### t1.c — Round 5 game-end (regression on issue #319)
| Aspect | Method | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Game ends at P2's END_SCORING in Round 5 | drove fresh game R1→R5, dispatched END_SCORING for P2 in Round 5 | `meta.game_ended=true`, `meta.winner=1`, "Game ended after 5 battle rounds", `battle_round` stayed at 5 (no rollover) ✅ |
| `meta.game_ended` and `meta.winner` set | both round-trip live this session | ✅ |
| Re-verification (live) | full play-through after #330/#331 fixes | ✅ regression intact |
| ⚠️ side-effect: `PhaseManager.game_ended` is sticky | discovered during this audit | ❌ filed as #330 (fixed in PR #334) |
| Re-verified post-game-end → new game flow | After Round 5 ended (PhaseManager.game_ended=true), called `initialize_default_state` + `transition_to_phase(FORMATIONS)` | game_ended cleared to false; current_phase_instance instantiated; CONFIRM_FORMATIONS for both players → DEPLOYMENT phase reached cleanly with all 9 P1 deploy options ✓ | pass | — |

### t1.d — AUTO_PHASE_ADVANCE timing
| Aspect | Method | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Phases emit `phase_completed` only when complete | code review | ⚠️ DeploymentPhase fires it on enter when `_all_units_deployed()` returns true; that check returns true vacuously when all 26 units are still UNDEPLOYED — issue #331 |
| Live trigger only on action exhaustion | live test (FORMATIONS→ROLL_OFF skip) | ❌ FAIL — see #331 |

### t1.e — Special-phase gating
| Aspect | Method | Result |
|---|---|---|
| FORMATIONS only at game start | `PhaseManager` initial transition is the only entry; no `_get_next_phase` returns it | ✅ |
| ROLL_OFF only between REDEPLOYMENT and SCOUT | `_get_next_phase`: REDEPLOYMENT→ROLL_OFF, ROLL_OFF→SCOUT — never returned again | ✅ |
| SCOUT only before first COMMAND | `_get_next_phase`: ROLL_OFF→SCOUT, SCOUT→COMMAND — never returned again | ✅ |
| REDEPLOYMENT runs unconditionally | `_get_next_phase`: DEPLOYMENT→REDEPLOYMENT every game | ⚠️ design question — per 10e, redeployment is detachment-conditional; not a bug per-se but worth flagging |

## Issues filed during Tier 0+1

| # | Title | Severity | Tier |
|---|-------|----------|------|
| [#329](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/329) | Single-player RNG non-deterministic — `payload.rng_seed` only honored by MovementPhase | High | 0 |
| [#330](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/330) | `PhaseManager.game_ended` is sticky across new games | Medium | 1 |
| [#331](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/331) | DEPLOYMENT phase auto-completes when entered — units never deployed | **Critical** | 1 |
| [#332](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/332) | SCOUT_MOVES orphan + MORALE→DEPLOYMENT dead/wrong fallback | Low | 1 |
| [#333](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/333) | MCP bridge `call_node_method` silently fails when args provided | Medium | 0 |

## Recommendations before Tier 2

1. ~~**Fix #331 first**~~ ✅ **FIXED** in branch `claude/audit-fix-cascade-and-game-ended` — root cause was a cascade: `BasePhase.execute_action` re-checks `_should_complete_phase()` after `process_action` returns, even if the action already emitted `phase_completed`. The signal then fires on the now-defunct phase whose connection is still wired to PhaseManager, causing PhaseManager to advance the *current* phase (which is the next one). Fix: guard the post-action check with `if pm.current_phase_instance == self`. Verified: `CONFIRM_FORMATIONS` for both players now correctly lands in DEPLOYMENT and stays.
2. ~~**Patch #330** alongside~~ ✅ **FIXED** in same branch — `PhaseManager.transition_to_phase(FORMATIONS)` now clears `game_ended`. Verified: after manually setting `game_ended=true`, transition to FORMATIONS clears it.
3. **Patch #329** before Tier 3 (unit abilities) — abilities trigger off dice; testing them properly needs determinism.
4. **#333** is convenience only — `execute_script` workaround is acceptable for the audit.
5. **#332** is cleanup — defer indefinitely.

## Tier 2+ blocker map

| Tier | Blocker | Workaround |
|------|---------|------------|
| 2 (per-phase rules) | #331 (can't reach deployed state scripted) | Build post-deploy save by hand from a UI-driven game, then load |
| 3 (unit abilities) | #329 (dice non-deterministic) | Multi-trial sampling for distribution; defer exact-outcome tests |
| 4 (edge cases) | #331, #329 | Same as above |
| 5 (save/load round-trips) | #330 (game_ended sticky may corrupt saves taken after game-end) | Verify save → reload → state is clean before proceeding |

---

## Tier 2 — Per-phase rules correctness

### Deployment Phase (in progress)

| ID | Rule | Method | Expected | Observed | Status | Issue |
|----|------|--------|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| t2.d1 | P1/P2 alternation on successful deploy | Deploy Shield-Captain, check `active_player` flip | 1 → 2 | 1 → 2 ✓ | pass | — |
| t2.d2a | Single-model out of zone rejected | DEPLOY_UNIT with center outside polygon | Validation fails, state unchanged, alternation does not flip | Rejected with "Model must be wholly within deployment zone"; status=UNDEPLOYED; active_player unchanged ✓ | pass | — |
| t2.d2b | Multi-model with one out-of-zone rejected | Witchseekers ×4, model 4 mid-board | Whole-action rejected, no per-model partial deploy | Rejected; all models stay UNDEPLOYED ✓ | pass | — |
| t2.d3 | 9" enemy distance rule | Crucible zones too far apart (≥32") to test in-zone; rule is auto-enforced | N/A in Crucible standard deploy | structurally untestable here | skip | — |
| t2.d4 | Unit coherency on initial deploy | Witchseekers ×4 with model 4 at 7" from siblings | Validation fails | **Deployment succeeded** — coherency not enforced | **fail** | [#335](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/335) |
| t2.d5 | Strategic Reserves placement | (deferred — needs formations restart with reserves declared) | — | — | deferred | — |
| t2.d6 | Post-deploy baseline save | Deploy all 26 units, save | full save | partial — to follow-up session | deferred | — |

### Findings
- [#335](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/335) — `DeploymentPhase._validate_deploy_unit_action()` only validates fields, ownership, and per-model zone containment. The 2" coherency rule (enforced in Movement / Charge / Fight) is missing from deployment. Models can be deployed at any distance and the unit ends up `status: DEPLOYED`. Bug surfaces silently — UI normally gates positions visually so this only manifests via scripted/save-edited deployments.
- 9" enemy distance rule cannot be exercised in Crucible of Battle (zones don't overlap, are >32" apart at narrowest). Defer testing until Reserves-arrival or Infiltrator audit, where the rule actually fires.

### Pending Tier 2 work — Deployment
- Strategic Reserves placement (t2.d5)
- ~~Post-deployment baseline save (t2.d6)~~ ✅ saved as `audit_baseline_postdeploy.w40ksave` (16 deployed, 10 in Strategic Reserves; reserves status set via direct mutation as a baseline shortcut due to terrain/zone packing constraints)

### Command Phase

| ID | Rule | Method | Expected | Observed | Status | Issue |
|----|------|--------|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| t2.c1 | CP gain on first Command phase | Drive new game to Round 1 P1 Command, check `players.{1,2}.cp` deltas vs initial state | 10e: Round 1 grants **no** CP | Both players gain +1 CP in Round 1 P1 Command (3 → 4 each) | **fail** | [#336](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/336) |
| t2.c1b | CP gain to opponent | Same | Only active player gains CP | Opponent also gains +1 | **fail** | [#336](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/336) |

### Findings (Tier 2 cumulative)
- [#335](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/335) — DeploymentPhase doesn't validate unit coherency
- [#336](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/336) — Command Phase CP gain doesn't match 10e (rule wrongly applied to round 1 + opponent)

### Movement Phase

| ID | Rule | Method | Expected | Observed | Status | Issue |
|----|------|--------|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| t2.m1 | Normal move within M" | Blade Champion (M=6"=240px) move from (120,100) to (120,280) = 180px / 4.5" | Position updates, flags.moved=true | Position updated; moved=true ✓ | pass | — |
| t2.m2 | Over-move rejected with proper error | Custodian Guard m1 from (200,100) to (200,400) = 7.5" > 6" cap | Error "Move exceeds cap: 7.5\" > 6.0\"" | Got exact error ✓ | pass | — |
| t2.m3 | Advance adds D6 to move cap | BEGIN_ADVANCE on Witchseekers (M=6"); roll D6 | move_cap_inches = 6 + roll | Roll=3, cap=9, advanced=true ✓; supports Command Re-roll integration | pass | — |
| t2.m4 | FLY allows ending on/through other models | Move Jetbike (FLY) onto / over a friendly Caladius (FLY) base | FLY allows pass-through; ending on top still rejected | "Cannot end move on top of another model" returned (engine correctly enforces no-end-on-top); pass-through verification deferred (path-overlap test setup needs fine-tuning) | partial | — |
| t2.m5 | Strategic Reserves blocked Round 1 | PLACE_REINFORCEMENT on Caladius in Round 1 | Reject with appropriate error | "Reserves cannot arrive until Battle Round 2 (currently Round 1)" ✓ | pass | — |
| t2.m6 | Base-touching tolerance (#321/#327 regression) | 32mm bases at 50.0px (0.4px under touching boundary) | Allowed within 0.5px tolerance | (deferred — needs precise positioning setup) | deferred | — |
| t2.m7 | Engaged unit restricted to Fall Back / Remain Stationary | WARBOSS_B engaged with Telemon (post-charge from prior turn) shows action menu | Only BEGIN_FALL_BACK and REMAIN_STATIONARY available — no normal move/advance | ✓ exactly those two options offered | pass | — |
| t2.m8 | Fall Back sets cannot_shoot/cannot_charge | BEGIN_FALL_BACK on engaged unit | flags.fell_back / cannot_shoot / cannot_charge all set | All three set ✓ — and Shooting/Charge phases respect the flags (rejected with "Unit cannot shoot" / "Unit cannot charge") | pass | — |
| t2.m9 | Fall Back gates on actual movement out of engagement | CONFIRM_UNIT_MOVE after failed SET_MODEL_DEST during Fall Back | Fall Back should require leaving engagement | Engine sets fell_back=true even though unit didn't move and is still in engagement | observation | (potential bug — same root cause as movement-without-movement observation) |
| t2.m10 | Strategic Reserves CAN arrive in Round 2 | PLACE_REINFORCEMENT for Caladius in Round 2 P1 Movement | Position set, status=DEPLOYED, arrived_from_reserves_turn tracked | All three changes applied ✓ | pass | — |
| t2.m12 | Strategic Reserves arrival within 6" of edge | PLACE_REINFORCEMENT for Wazbom at (800, 1500) — 20" from edge | Reject | "Strategic Reserves must be within 6\" of a battlefield edge (nearest edge: 20.0\")" ✓ | pass | — |
| t2.m13 | Strategic Reserves arrival >9" from enemies | PLACE_REINFORCEMENT for Wazbom at (100, 100) — 4.1" from a P1 unit | Reject | "must be >9\" from enemy models (currently 4.1\")" ✓ | pass | — |
| t2.m14 | Strategic Reserves arrival success | PLACE_REINFORCEMENT for Wazbom at (1700, 100) — within 6" of right edge, >9" from enemies | Place succeeds, arrived_from_reserves_turn tracked | Position set, status=DEPLOYED, arrived_from_reserves_turn=3 ✓ | pass | — |

### Movement Phase observations
- `CONFIRM_UNIT_MOVE` after a failed `SET_MODEL_DEST` succeeded with `flags.moved=true` even though no model actually moved (ended at original position). This is **probably intentional** (player "moved" 0 inches, which counts as "moved" for subsequent rules) but worth noting since it differs from `REMAIN_STATIONARY` which sets `flags.remained_stationary`. Different downstream effects (e.g., heavy weapons -1 to hit if `moved`, but unaffected if `remained_stationary`).
- Engine validates over-move with clear error message including measured and cap distances — good UX.
- Advance roll fires D6 immediately on `BEGIN_ADVANCE` and integrates with Command Re-roll stratagem (`awaiting_reroll: true` returned).

### Shooting Phase (in progress)

| ID | Rule | Method | Expected | Observed | Status | Issue |
|----|------|--------|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| t2.s1 | Eligibility filter (range/visibility) | Try SELECT_SHOOTER on a unit far from any target | "no eligible targets" | Got exact error ✓ | pass | — |
| t2.s3 | End-to-end attack resolution | Telemon (8 attacks, BS 2+, S6, AP-1, D2) shoots Warboss | Hits → wounds → save data; sub-step traces | All sub-traces present (to_hit, to_wound, save_data); stratagem opportunity offered | pass (with #337 caveat) | — |
| t2.s3a | BIG GUNS NEVER TIRE gating | Vehicle out of engagement, target out of engagement of friendlies | No -1 to hit penalty | -1 applied unconditionally | **fail** | [#337](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/337) |
| t2.s8 | LoS / visibility blocking | Caladius at (200, 580) targets Warboss at (200, 2300) — straight-line ~43" through middle of board (likely crosses ruins terrain) | Engine excludes targets without true line-of-sight | "Unit has no eligible targets to shoot" returned despite range and engagement-clear, likely due to terrain blocking | pass (inferred) | — |
| t2.s9 | **Blast weapon restriction** | Wazbom Twin wazbom mega-kannon (BLAST) targets Caladius which is in engagement with friendly Warboss B | Reject — 10e: Blast can't target unit in engagement of friendlies | "Cannot fire Blast weapon at unit in Engagement Range of friendly units" ✓ | pass | — |
| t2.s10 | **Hazardous keyword post-attack check** | Wazbom Twin wazbom mega-kannon (HAZARDOUS) shoots Caladius (after Warboss removed) | Engine emits hazardous_check after to-hit, counts 1s, fires MWs on bearer if any | `hazardous_check` context returned with `rolls: [4]`, `ones_rolled: 0`, `triggered: false` ✓ | pass | — |
| t2.s11 | **Sequential weapon resolution** | Wazbom resolves multiple weapons in sequence | Each weapon's to-hit/to-wound + hazardous separately | `current_weapon_index`, `remaining_weapons`, `total_weapons`, `sequential_pause: true` returned ✓ | pass | — |
| t2.s2/s4-s7 | Advance-blocks-shoot, Sustained/Lethal/Devastating, Cover, LOOK OUT SIR | (deferred — needs determinism for keyword tests, more setup for cover/LOS) | — | — | deferred | — |

### Shooting Phase observations
- **Stratagem timing windows work correctly**: After `CONFIRM_TARGETS`, the engine surfaces the opponent's reactive stratagem options ("Go to Ground" was offered on Warboss). Confirms 10e timing trigger `after_target_selected` is honoured.
- Pipeline structure matches 10e: SELECT_SHOOTER → ASSIGN_TARGET (per weapon, with model_ids and weapon_id in payload) → CONFIRM_TARGETS → reactive stratagem window → RESOLVE_SHOOTING → APPLY_SAVES (interactive save resolution).
- Hit/wound/save sub-traces are richly detailed — each step returns dice, modifiers, threshold, special-rules flags. Excellent for debugging and audit.

### Charge Phase

| ID | Rule | Method | Expected | Observed | Status | Issue |
|----|------|--------|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| t2.ch1 | Charge declaration with valid target | Telemon at (50, 2000) declares charge on Warboss at (50, 2330) | Engine accepts, offers Fire Overwatch to opponent | ✓ overwatch offered (6 P2 units eligible) | pass | — |
| t2.ch1b | Charge declaration beyond 12" | Telemon at (50, 1500) declares charge on Warboss (20.75" away) | Reject "Target beyond 12\" charge range" | ✓ exact error returned | pass | — |
| t2.ch2 | 2D6 charge roll | CHARGE_ROLL action | 2D6 dice, total compared to min_distance (base-aware), Command Re-roll integration | Rolled [6,3]=9, min_distance=5.49"; awaiting_reroll=true ✓ | pass | — |
| t2.ch3 | Reserves filter (#320 regression) | List eligible chargers and targets | Reserves units (Boyz/Battlewagon/etc) absent | ✓ none of the 10 reserves units appear | pass | — |
| t2.ch4 | Cannot end in engagement of non-target | Apply charge to position close to WARBOSS_B but also within 1" of WARBOSS_C | Reject | ✓ "Cannot end within engagement range of non-target unit: Warboss" | pass | — |
| t2.ch5 | Charged unit gets fights_first flag | After successful APPLY_CHARGE_MOVE, check Telemon's flags | flags.charged_this_turn = true, flags.fights_first = true | Both set ✓ + WARBOSS_B.has_been_charged set | pass | — |
| t2.ch6 | Tank Shock stratagem trigger on vehicle charge | After vehicle charge applied | Engine offers Tank Shock | ✓ trigger_tank_shock=true | pass | — |

### Fight Phase (partial)

| ID | Rule | Method | Expected | Observed | Status | Issue |
|----|------|--------|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| t2.f1 | Charger eligible to fight first | After charge, FIGHT phase shows Telemon as fighter | SELECT_FIGHTER offered for Telemon | ✓ only Telemon (the charger) offered | pass | — |
| t2.f1b | Custodes Martial Ka'tah stance triggers on melee | SELECT_FIGHTER on Custodes unit | trigger_katah_stance fires, master_of_the_stances_available checked | ✓ both fields returned correctly | pass | — |
| t2.f1c | Pile-in action | PILE_IN dispatched | Pile-in resolves, attack assignment triggered | ✓ trigger_attack_assignment=true with correct attack_targets | pass | — |
| t2.f2 | Weapon name disambiguation in ASSIGN_ATTACKS | Assign "Telemon Caestus" (which has both ranged and melee modes with same name) | Engine resolves to melee mode in melee context | "Weapon is not a melee weapon: Telemon Caestus" — engine resolves to ranged variant by name | observation | (potential — needs investigation) |
| t2.f2b | Melee pipeline (no name collision) | Caladius "Armoured hull" (single, melee-only) on Warboss | Hit→wound→save | 4 attacks WS4+: [6,6,6,1] = 3 hits (3 crits); wound S6 vs T5 = 3+: [3,4,5] = 3 wounds; save data: AP 0, D1, ignores_cover=true ✓ | pass | — |

### Charge / Fight observations
- **All 7 charge tests pass** — declaration, range validation, 2D6 mechanic, reserves filter (#320 regression intact), engagement-of-non-target rule, fights_first flag wiring, vehicle Tank Shock stratagem. This is one of the cleanest phases in the audit so far.
- **Heroic Intervention stratagem** correctly offered to opponent at end of charge with 3 eligible P2 character units listed.
- **Custodes Martial Ka'tah stance** triggers correctly via `trigger_katah_stance` flag on `SELECT_FIGHTER` for Custodes models.
- **Weapon name collision**: `Telemon Caestus` exists as both a Ranged (12") and Melee weapon entry in army JSON. `ASSIGN_ATTACKS` (melee context) by name resolves to the ranged variant first and fails. May be a minor bug or may require passing weapon index/disambiguator. Worth investigating; not yet filed pending more reproduction cases.

### Scoring Phase

| ID | Rule | Method | Expected | Observed | Status | Issue |
|----|------|--------|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| t2.sc1 | Initial VP allocation | Inspect VPs at end of Round 1 P1 scoring | Primary 0 (no objectives held), Secondary depends on mission state | P1 primary=0 ✓, P1 secondary=5 (resolved: Display of Might mission triggered "more_units_wholly_in_no_mans_land_than_opponent" because Telemon and Jetbike were direct-mutated into no man's land during T2.S3 shooting setup; mission moved to discard, score retained — legitimate scoring) | pass | — |
| t2.sc2 | Player swap on END_SCORING | P1 dispatches END_SCORING | active_player → 2, phase → COMMAND, battle_round unchanged | Exactly that ✓ | pass | — |
| t2.sc3 | Phase machinery cleanup on swap | Check WARBOSS_B.has_been_charged after swap | Should be cleared | ✓ removed via op:remove | pass | — |
| t2.sc4 | END_<predecessor> idempotency in successor (#322 regression) | END_SCORING dispatched in COMMAND phase | Accept as no-op | success=true, changes=[] ✓ | pass | — |
| t2.sc5 | END_<two-phases-back> rejected | END_FIGHT dispatched in COMMAND | Reject (FIGHT is not COMMAND's immediate predecessor) | "Unknown action type: END_FIGHT" ✓ | pass | — |
| t2.sc6 | DISCARD_SECONDARY grants 1 CP | P2 has 5 CP, dispatch DISCARD_SECONDARY mission_index 0 (Display of Might) | CP increases by 1 | cp_gained=1, P2 CP went 5→6 ✓ | pass | — |
| t2.sc7 | USE_NEW_ORDERS deducts 1 CP and draws new mission | P1 has 7 CP, dispatch USE_NEW_ORDERS mission_index 0 | CP -1, old mission discarded, new mission drawn | discarded="No Prisoners", drawn="Extend Battle Lines", P1 CP 7→6 ✓ | pass | — |

### Scoring observations
- Player swap on END_SCORING works cleanly. State diff includes both `meta.active_player` flip and unit-flag cleanup (`has_been_charged` reset).
- **P1 has 5 secondary VP after the first scoring phase** with no kills, no objectives held, and only 1 turn played. This is suspicious — either a free score grant, an automatic mission award, or a real bug. Logged for follow-up; deferred until isolated reproduction.
- Round 1 had two Command phases (P1's, then P2's), which under #336 means both players gained 2 CP each (now at 5 CP). Per 10e the first Command phase of the game should grant nothing.
- Custodes detachment options (`SELECT_MARTIAL_MASTERY`) appeared correctly in P1's Command phase. Orks Waaagh! options (`CALL_WAAAGH`, `PLANT_WAAAGH_BANNER`) appeared correctly in P2's. Faction-rule timing is wired.

## Stratagem sweep (2026-05-04)

24 stratagems registered (12 core + 12 faction). Test focus: effect application, CP cost, once-per-X locks, unimplemented gating.

| ID | Item | Method | Expected | Observed | Status | Issue |
|----|------|--------|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| ss1 | **INSANE BRAVERY** (core, before_battle_shock_test) | Witchseekers C below half, dispatch USE_STRATAGEM insane_bravery | CP -1, BS test auto-passed, unit not battle-shocked | "Witchseekers AUTO-PASSED battle-shock test (INSANE BRAVERY - 1 CP)"; P1 CP 5→4; flags clean (no battle_shocked) ✓ | pass | — |
| ss2 | **ARCANE GENETIC ALCHEMY** (Custodes Shield Host, 1 CP, any phase, after_mortal_wound) | Dispatch USE_STRATAGEM on Contemptor Dreadnought | CP -1, target gets flags.effect_fnp=4 | Diffs applied: P1 CP 4→3, U_CONTEMPTOR-ACHILLUS_DREADNOUGHT_H.flags.effect_fnp=4 ✓ | pass | — |
| ss3 | **Once-per-phase lock** | Re-dispatch ARCANE GENETIC ALCHEMY on a different unit | Reject | "ARCANE GENETIC ALCHEMY can only be used once per phase" ✓ | pass | — |
| ss4 | **Unimplemented stratagem gating** | Dispatch AVENGE THE FALLEN (which has `implemented: false` from FactionStratagemLoader because effect text is "custom:unmapped") | Reject without CP deduction | "AVENGE THE FALLEN is not yet mechanically implemented"; P1 CP unchanged at 3 ✓ | pass | — |

### Stratagem sweep findings
- **Implementation status of faction stratagems is split**: of the 12 loaded faction stratagems, 6 have `implemented: true` (effects auto-parse to known types) and 6 are flagged `implemented: false` with `effects: [{type: "custom:unmapped"}]`. The engine correctly rejects use of `implemented: false` stratagems without burning CP.
- **5 stratagems have manual implementation overrides** in `StratagemManager._mark_custom_handlers()` (lines 478-497): GRAB AND BASH, BOARDIN' RUSH, ROLLING LOOT-HEAP, DECK FRAGGERS, KRUMP AND RUN. These aren't loaded with the current Custodes/Orks armies in the test scenario.
- **Effect primitives recognized by FactionStratagemLoader**: `grant_fnp`, `grant_invuln`, `grant_cover`, `grant_stealth`, `grant_keyword` (with scope), `grant_aura`. Anything else falls through to `custom:unmapped`.

## Stratagem coverage matrix (24 loaded stratagems)

Coverage legend:
- ✅ **EFFECT VERIFIED LIVE** — actually triggered the action, observed CP delta + state change
- 🟡 **TRIGGER OFFER ONLY** — engine offered the stratagem at the right moment but full end-to-end effect was not invoked
- 🚫 **REJECTION ONLY** — verified the engine refuses to use it (for `implemented: false` stratagems)
- ❌ **NOT TESTED** — verified to exist + load, but no live test of effect or rejection

### Core stratagems (12)

| # | ID | CP | Phase / Trigger | Effect primitive | Coverage | Notes / Setup needed for full test |
|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 1 | INSANE BRAVERY | 1 | command / before_battle_shock_test | `auto_pass_battle_shock` | ✅ EFFECT VERIFIED | t2.ss1 — Witchseekers C below half, dispatch USE_STRATAGEM → BS auto-passed, P1 CP -1, no battle_shocked flag |
| 2 | COMMAND RE-ROLL | 1 | any / after_roll | `reroll_last_roll` | 🟡 TRIGGER ONLY | Setup: dispatch any roll-producing action; engine returns `awaiting_reroll: true` (verified live during BEGIN_ADVANCE in audit). Not verified: actual re-roll execution, CP deduction, dice swap. To test fully: BEGIN_ADVANCE → see roll → USE_REACTIVE_STRATAGEM command_re_roll → verify CP -1 and dice differ |
| 3 | GO TO GROUND | 1 | shooting / after_target_selected | `grant_invuln` 6+ + `grant_cover` | ✅ EFFECT VERIFIED | t2.st1 — P2 used during P1 Caladius shooting on Warboss B. CP P2 5→4, Warboss flags.effect_invuln=6, effect_cover=true ✓ |
| 4 | SMOKESCREEN | 1 | shooting / after_target_selected | `grant_cover` + `grant_stealth` | ❌ NOT TESTED | Setup: P1 (with INFANTRY/MOUNTED/BIKER target restriction) targets a P2 INFANTRY unit during shooting → P2 reactive USE_REACTIVE_STRATAGEM smokescreen → verify P2 CP -1 + target flags.effect_cover + effect_stealth |
| 5 | EPIC CHALLENGE | 1 | fight / fighter_selected | `grant_keyword` PRECISION (melee) | 🟡 TRIGGER ONLY | t2.f1b — Engine fired `trigger_epic_challenge` when WARBOSS_B selected to fight. Not verified: actual PRECISION keyword application to melee attacks. To test: fighter selects target unit with attached CHARACTER → use stratagem → verify PRECISION applied |
| 6 | GRENADE | 1 | shooting / shooting_phase_active | `mortal_wounds` (D6, 4+) | ❌ NOT TESTED | Setup: P1 INFANTRY unit with no other ranged-attack assignment within ~6" of P2 unit → USE_STRATAGEM grenade in shooting phase → verify D6 dice rolled, hits at 4+ deal 1 MW each, CP -1 |
| 7 | TANK SHOCK | 1 | charge / after_charge_move | `mortal_wounds_toughness_based` (5+, max 6) | 🟡 TRIGGER ONLY | t2.ch6 — Engine fired `trigger_tank_shock` after Telemon vehicle charge. Not verified: actual MW dice roll, CP deduction, damage applied. To test: vehicle charges → engine offers Tank Shock → USE_STRATAGEM tank_shock → verify dice roll + MWs applied to target, CP -1 |
| 8 | FIRE OVERWATCH | 1 | movement_or_charge / enemy_move_or_charge | `overwatch_shoot` (hit_on 6) | 🟡 TRIGGER ONLY | t2.ch6 + t2.e3 — Engine fired `trigger_fire_overwatch` on charge declaration AND on Jetbike movement near P2. Not verified: full overwatch shooting resolution at 6+ to hit. To test: defender USE_REACTIVE_STRATAGEM fire_overwatch → verify dice resolution with 6+ threshold, CP -1, possible damage |
| 9 | HEROIC INTERVENTION | 1 | charge / after_enemy_charge_move | `counter_charge` (no_charge_bonus) | 🟡 TRIGGER ONLY | Engine fired `trigger_heroic_intervention` after Telemon charged.

To test: enemy charge → defender USE_STRATAGEM heroic_intervention with eligible CHARACTER → verify CHARACTER moves up to 6" into engagement, CP -1 |
| 10 | COUNTER-OFFENSIVE | 2 | fight / after_enemy_fought | `fight_next` | 🟡 TRIGGER ONLY | Engine fired `trigger_counter_offensive` after Caladius fought. Not verified: actual interrupt effect, CP -2 deduction. To test: fight → opponent unit completes attacks → USE_STRATAGEM counter_offensive → verify defender unit selected to fight next, CP -2 |
| 11 | NEW ORDERS | 1 | command / end_of_command_phase | (Crucible mission swap) | ✅ EFFECT VERIFIED | t2.sc7 — P1 7→6 CP, mission discarded, replacement drawn |
| 12 | RAPID INGRESS | 1 | movement / end_of_enemy_movement | `arrive_from_reserves` (allow_deep_strike) | ❌ NOT TESTED | Setup: P1 has reserves, P2 starts movement phase → P1 USE_STRATAGEM rapid_ingress → place unit (deep strike allowed even though it's opponent's turn) → verify CP -1, unit deployed with `arrived_from_reserves_turn` set |

### Coverage summary

Updated 2026-05-04 after PR #358 fixed [#356](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/356) (cannot_shoot lockout now respects `effect_fall_back_and_shoot`).

| Status | Count | Stratagems |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ EFFECT VERIFIED LIVE | **7** | INSANE BRAVERY, GO TO GROUND, NEW ORDERS, ARCANE GENETIC ALCHEMY, ARCHEOTECH MUNITIONS, UNBRIDLED CARNAGE, **MULTIPOTENTIALITY** |
| ⚠️ EFFECT FIRES BUT NOT HONORED | **0** | (was MULTIPOTENTIALITY, fixed in PR #358) |
| 🟡 TRIGGER OFFER ONLY | **6** | COMMAND RE-ROLL, EPIC CHALLENGE, TANK SHOCK, FIRE OVERWATCH, HEROIC INTERVENTION, COUNTER-OFFENSIVE |
| 🚫 REJECTION VERIFIED | **6** | AVENGE THE FALLEN, VIGILANCE ETERNAL, MOB RULE, 'ERE WE GO, CAREEN, ORKS IS NEVER BEATEN |
| ❌ TARGET FILTER BLOCKS QUICK TEST | **2** | **UNWAVERING SENTINELS** (phase: fight, requires CUSTODES INFANTRY on objective being targeted), **'ARD AS NAILS** (requires VEHICLE/MONSTER ORKS being targeted — none deployed in standard scenario) |
| ❌ NEED SCENARIO SETUP | **3** | SMOKESCREEN (needs MOUNTED/BIKER/JUMP PACK target), GRENADE (needs INFANTRY with grenade-equipped weapon — Custodes lack), RAPID INGRESS (needs P1 reserves during P2 movement) |

### Tests added 2026-05-04 (post PR #355)

| ID | Stratagem | Method | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| ss5 | ARCHEOTECH MUNITIONS | USE_STRATAGEM in Shooting phase on Custodes Contemptor | P1 CP 4→3, `effect_lethal_hits=true`, `effect_sustained_hits=true` ✓ |
| ss6 | MULTIPOTENTIALITY | After Telemon fall-back, USE_STRATAGEM | P1 CP 4→3, `effect_fall_back_and_shoot=true`, `effect_fall_back_and_charge=true` set ✓; initially blocked by `cannot_shoot` gate ([#356](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/356)). **Fixed in PR #358**: ShootingPhase + RulesEngine.validate_shoot now honor the override flag. Live-verified: with effect set, a `fell_back=true,cannot_shoot=true` Custodian Guard passes the gate (rejection moves to downstream "no eligible targets"); debug log shows new "overriding cannot_shoot" print firing |
| ss7 | UNBRIDLED CARNAGE | USE_STRATAGEM in Fight phase on Warboss B | P2 CP 5→4, `effect_crit_hit_on=5` ✓ |
| ss8 | UNWAVERING SENTINELS | (attempted) | Not triggerable from current scenarios — phase=fight + requires `on_objective` |
| ss9 | 'ARD AS NAILS | (attempted) | Not triggerable — requires VEHICLE/MONSTER ORKS target; current P2 deployed list is INFANTRY-only |

### Test infrastructure verified
- `RulesEngine.set_test_seed(seed)` / `get_test_seed()` round-trip via MCP bridge ✓ (PR #352)
- `bgnt_penalty_applied: false` for vehicle shooting outside engagement (#337) verified live ✓
- New `USE_STRATAGEM` handlers in Movement/Shooting/Charge/Fight phases functional (PR #355) ✓

**7 of 24 stratagems** have their effects fully verified end-to-end (post PR #358 closing #356). **6 stratagems are confirmed to be `implemented: false`** in the engine and gracefully rejected. **6 stratagems** had only their trigger window verified — the actual effect of the stratagem (CP deduction + state change) was not invoked. **8 stratagems** are loaded and `implemented: true`, but their effects were never invoked in any test.

### Why some weren't tested
- **Each effect-test requires a specific game scenario** (e.g., enemy charging a unit with attached CHARACTER for HEROIC INTERVENTION, vehicle finishing a charge for TANK SHOCK, defender shooting at INFANTRY for SMOKESCREEN).
- **Many active stratagems (in Movement / Shooting / Charge / Fight phases) have no `dispatch_action` route** — see [#353](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/353). The phase action handlers don't have a `USE_STRATAGEM` case (only `USE_REACTIVE_STRATAGEM` for defender + `USE_GRENADE_STRATAGEM` as a hardcoded carve-out). Affected: ARCHEOTECH MUNITIONS, UNBRIDLED CARNAGE, MULTIPOTENTIALITY, UNWAVERING SENTINELS, 'ARD AS NAILS. They are loaded with `implemented: true` and `StratagemManager.use_stratagem()` would apply their effects, but the dispatcher doesn't route to it.
- **Determinism unblocked**: PR #352 added `RulesEngine.set_test_seed(seed)` / `get_test_seed()` static helpers. Calling `get_node('/root/RulesEngine').set_test_seed(42)` now makes all unseeded `RNGService.new()` instances deterministic, enabling reproducible dice tests for GRENADE, TANK SHOCK, FIRE OVERWATCH effects.

### Verifications added 2026-05-04 (post PR #352)
- `set_test_seed(42)` / `get_test_seed()` round-trips correctly via the MCP bridge ✓
- `hash([42, 1])` produces the same value across calls (Expression-level determinism check) ✓
- `bgnt_penalty_applied: false` observed live during a Caladius shooting attack with no engagement context — **PR #343 fix #337 verified live in fresh game** ✓ (this was previously code-only verified)

To complete coverage of the remaining stratagems, fixing [#353](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/353) (adding `USE_STRATAGEM` handlers to Movement/Shooting/Charge/Fight phases) would unblock 5 of the 8 ❌ NOT TESTED entries. The other 3 (SMOKESCREEN reactive, RAPID INGRESS, GRENADE) need scenario setup but no engine changes.

### Pending phases
- Movement: t2.m4 (FLY pass-through path test), t2.m6 (base-touching regression) deferred
- Shooting: t2.s2 (advance-blocks-shoot), t2.s4-s7 (keywords + cover) deferred — most need determinism (#329)
- Fight: t2.f2 melee attack pipeline blocked by weapon-name-collision; deferred
- Scoring: P1's 5 secondary VP at Round 1 end needs isolated reproduction (likely legitimate Display of Might score)

## Tier 5 — Save/load round-trips

| ID | Item | Method | Expected | Observed | Status | Issue |
|----|------|--------|----------|----------|--------|-------|

### Findings — autoload state not round-tripped
- [#338](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/338) — `FactionAbilityManager.get_state_for_save()` / `load_state()` exist but are **never called**. State lost: Waaagh!, Plant the Banner, Martial Mastery selection, doctrines, enhancements (Da Kaptin / Bionik Workshop / Razgit), loot objective.
- Same pattern: `StratagemManager` has no save/load API — `_usage_history` (once-per-battle/turn/phase tracking for all stratagems) is never persisted. Save scumming fully resets stratagem locks.
- Same pattern likely extends to `SecondaryMissionManager` (deck state, drawn missions) and possibly `MissionManager` (objective burn state for Scorched Earth).

### Pattern note
Per-game state lives in two places:
1. `GameState.state` dict — round-tripped via `StateSerializer`
2. Autoload member fields — must be explicitly serialised via `get_state_for_save` / `load_state` calls in `SaveLoadManager`

The audit found at least two autoloads (`FactionAbilityManager`, `StratagemManager`) where (2) is not wired up, plus one where the parallel issue (`PhaseManager.game_ended` surviving `initialize_default_state`) was already filed as [#330](https://github.com/BigBobbo/warhammer-40k-godot/issues/330) and fixed in PR #334. This is a **recurring class of bug** worth a one-pass audit of every autoload.
