## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Week 1-2)
1. ✅ Fix broken test infrastructure (COMPLETED)
2. Validate all existing tests
3. Document test status for each file
4. Fix remaining test failures (Fight Phase: 8 failures)

### Short-term Actions (Week 3-6)
1. Add save/load integration tests
2. Add transport system tests
3. Add E2E workflow tests
4. Expand morale phase tests

### Medium-term Actions (Week 7-12)
1. Add regression test suite
2. Add performance testing
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline
4. Improve documentation
