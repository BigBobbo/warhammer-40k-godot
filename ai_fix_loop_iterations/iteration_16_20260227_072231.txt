### Game Results (4 games, all completed)

| Game | Winner | P1 VP | P2 VP | P1 Kills | P2 Kills | P1 Sec | P2 Sec |
|------|--------|-------|-------|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | P1 | 63 | 45 | 2 | 0 | 18 | 0 |
| 2 | P1 | 75 | 43 | 2 | 0 | 25 | 3 |
| 3 | P1 | 48 | 40 | 1 | 0 | 8 | 0 |
| 4 | P1 | 76 | 49 | 5 | 1 | 26 | 9 |
| **Avg** | - | **65.5** | **44.3** | **2.5** | **0.25** | **19.3** | **3.0** |

### Key Findings

- **P1 avg VP: 65.5** — best session ever (up from 58.4)
- **P1 record-tying 76 VP** in Game 4
- **While_active fix confirmed working** — missions flagged and swapped/discarded in R3+
- **BEL deck filter confirmed working** — Ork deck reduced from 15 to 14 cards
- **P2 secondary VP improved from 0 to 9** across the session as fixes took effect
- **P2 killed Blade Champion** in Game 4 — first Ork kill in 2 sessions
- **All 4 games completed, 0 stalls, 0 crashes**

### What Still Needs Work
- P1 100% win rate — competitive balance needs improvement
- MICRO_OVERKILL_DECAY 0.35 may benefit Custodes more than Orks (consider 0.25)
- P2 secondary VP still 0 in 2/4 games — replacement draws after while_active swap are random
- Ork melee kills remain near zero (1 across 4 games)
