## Session 5 Summary

### Changes Made
1. **Fixed Painboss can_lead** (`40k/armies/orks.json`): Added `"BOYZ"` to the Painboss's `can_lead` list. Now the Painboss attaches to Boyz (score 2.84, highest Ork attachment) with its FNP 5+ defensive buff.

2. **Added charge coordination tracker** (`40k/scripts/AIDecisionMaker.gd`): New static variable `_charge_coordination` tracks which targets have already been declared as charge targets in the current phase. Subsequent chargers get bonuses:
   - +5.0 **KILL GANG-UP** when combined damage can kill the target
   - +2.0 per existing charger for pile-on concentration

### Results (4 games played)

| Game | Winner | P1 VP | P2 VP | Kills |

| 3 | **P2 (Orks)** | 45 | **55** | 5 |
| 4 | P1 (Custodes) | **66** | 38 | 6 |

### Key Achievements
- **First Ork wins EVER** — Orks won 2 of 4 games (50% win rate, up from 0% across 6 previous games)
- **P2 hit 50 primary VP cap** for the first time in Game 1
- **Painboss bodyguard attachment** working in all games — FNP 5+ protecting Boyz squads
- **Charge coordination** triggering up to 9 pile-on charges per game

### Still Needs Work

- 3 of 5 Ork characters remain unattached and vulnerable
