## Session 11 Summary

### Changes Made
1. **Behind Enemy Lines proximity bonus** (`AIDecisionMaker.gd`): Replaced the broken `eval.is_enemy_home` gate with a diagonal-distance-based proximity bonus that applies to any movement destination closer to the enemy deployment zone center. Also fixed the achievability assessment which was comparing inches to pixels.

2. **Engage on All Fronts improvements** (`AIDecisionMaker.gd`): Increased `SECONDARY_SPREAD_BONUS` from 2.0 to 5.0. Replaced the simple unit-count achievability with position-aware assessment that checks actual table quarter coverage.

3. **Late-game objective denial** (`AIDecisionMaker.gd`): Added priority bonus for contesting enemy-held objectives in rounds 3-5, scaling from +1.5-3.0 (R3) to +2.5-5.0 (R5).
