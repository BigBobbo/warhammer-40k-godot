## Summary

This iteration made significant improvements to the Ork AI's competitive performance:

### Key Changes Made

1. **Fixed Ork over-aggression** (the biggest issue):
   - Reduced faction aggression from 2.2 → 1.6
   - Changed 3 code paths where Orks abandoned objectives to chase enemies at 999" distance, replacing with smart round-based limits (12-18")
   - Added OC-aware hold decisions — Orks now stay on contested objectives instead of chasing distant enemies

2. **Improved secondary mission management**:
   - Added New Orders evaluation in Command Phase — AI can now swap unachievable missions
   - Lowered action mission achievability from 0.4 → 0.1 (AI can't perform these actions, so it shouldn't hold dead cards)

3. **Improved charge targeting**:
   - Added focus charge bonus (+3.0) when friendly units already fighting same target
   - Added kill-priority bonus (+3.0) when charge can likely destroy the target
   - Added wounded-target bonus (+2.0) when charge does 50%+ of remaining wounds

4. **Rebalanced strategy constants**:
   - Early game objective weight 0.7 → 0.85 (objectives matter from round 1)
   - Late game objective weight 1.4 → 1.6 (stronger late-game objective focus)
