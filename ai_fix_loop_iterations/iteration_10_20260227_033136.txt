## Session 12 Summary

### Bugs Fixed (5 total)

1. **CRITICAL: Marked for Death target selection used wrong player's units** (`AIPlayer.gd`) — Selected drawing player's OWN units instead of opponent's. Fixed to use `opponent` variable. This bug caused MFD to NEVER score across 38+ games.

2. **Marked for Death status filter wrong** (`AIPlayer.gd`) — Checked `status == 1` (DEPLOYING) instead of `status >= 2` (DEPLOYED). Units were never found, causing "Cannot resolve" fallback.

3. **Movement phase stall: SKIP_UNIT not supported** (`AIPlayer.gd`) — When a movement action failed, AI sent `SKIP_UNIT` which MovementPhase doesn't handle. Changed to `REMAIN_STATIONARY`.

4. **Behind Enemy Lines achievability too high** (`AIDecisionMaker.gd`) — Lowered from 0.15 to 0.1 so it gets swapped by New Orders.

5. **No target priority for Marked for Death targets** (`AIDecisionMaker.gd`) — Added `marked_targets` to secondary awareness with 50% shooting/fighting priority boost.
