## Session 13 Summary

### Changes Made

**5 code fixes across 2 files:**

1. **Objective retention bonus (T12-1)** — `AIDecisionMaker.gd`: Reduced `WEIGHT_ALREADY_HELD_OBJ` from -8.0 to -3.0, and added +2.0 to +5.0 retention bonus for held objectives in rounds 2-5. This prevents units from abandoning captured objectives.

2. **Reduced denial bonus** — `AIDecisionMaker.gd`: Cut objective denial bonus by ~50% (enemy_weak: 1.5-2.5 instead of 3.0-5.0; enemy_strong: 0.5-1.5 instead of 1.5-2.5).

3. **Kill-based secondary movement bonuses (T12-2)** — `AIDecisionMaker.gd`: Added proximity-based movement bonuses for No Prisoners (+2.0 near enemies) and Overwhelming Force (+2.5 near enemies on objectives).

4. **Fight attack retry counter (T12-3)** — `AIDecisionMaker.gd`: After 2 failed ASSIGN_ATTACKS attempts, forces CONSOLIDATE to break the loop.

5. **Pile-in double failure handler (T12-4)** — `AIPlayer.gd`: After pile-in retry with empty movements also fails, sends CONSOLIDATE instead of infinite retry.
