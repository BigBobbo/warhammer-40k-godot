## Session 14 Complete — Summary

### Changes Made
**File: `40k/scripts/AIDecisionMaker.gd`** — 6 improvements:

1. **Early objective priority 0.85 → 0.95** — Units rush objectives faster for Round 2 scoring
2. **Round 2 NML urgency +1.5** — NML objectives get extra priority in the first scoring round
3. **Round 2 held/threatened retention +1.2** — Keep units on held objectives during first scoring
4. **Held_threatened retention bonus** — New scaling bonus: +1.5 R2 → +3.75 R5 (prevents abandoning contested objectives)
5. **Round-scaled on-objective bonus** — +5.0 R1 → +6.0 R2-3 → +7.0 R4-5 (staying put becomes more valuable)
6. **Dynamic secondary achievability** — Area Denial now checks enemy density near center (returns 0.15-0.55 instead of flat 0.40); A Tempting Target now checks actual objective control state (returns 0.3-0.8 instead of flat 0.40)
