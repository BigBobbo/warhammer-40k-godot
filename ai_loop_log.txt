## Summary

I ran 4 AI vs AI matches with search_and_destroy deployment and found/fixed 3 critical bugs preventing AI kills:

### Bugs Fixed:

1. **Shooting LoS validation (critical)** — The focus fire plan assigned weapons to targets without checking Line of Sight. All SHOOT actions were rejected by the rules engine ("No valid targets in range and LoS"). Added `_can_shooter_see_target()` that calls `RulesEngine._check_target_visibility()` before assigning weapons.

2. **Charge base-to-base contact (critical)** — The charge move computation placed models with too much gap (2px safety margin + non-target enemy avoidance pushing models away). The ChargePhase validator requires edge-to-edge distance <= 0.25" (10px). Fixed by reducing gap to 1px and adding post-adjustment enforcement that overrides enemy avoidance to ensure base contact.

3. **Multi-model charge overlap (critical)** — Multi-model units (e.g., 3 Witchseekers) all moved to the same position, causing self-overlap validation failures. Fixed by adding 60-degree angular offset per model around the target.

### Aggression Tuning:
- Ork faction aggression: 1.8 → 2.2
- Early charge threshold: 0.6 → 0.4
- Melee seek bonuses increased ~50%
- Melee threat avoidance nearly eliminated

### Result:
**Blade Champion successfully charged and DESTROYED the Warboss** in round 3 melee — 5 attacks, 4 hits, 4 wounds (including Devastating Wounds), killing the model. Shooting also now successfully lands damage each round (Caladius Grav-tank dealing 4+ wounds per phase).

Claude status: KILLS_FOUND: Blade Champion destroyed Warboss in melee (Round 3 fight phase) — 5 attacks, 4 hits, 4 wounds, 1 Devastating Wounds. Fixed 3 bugs: shooting LoS validation, charge base-to-base contact, multi-model charge overlap. Increased Ork aggression constants.
SUCCESS! Units were killed on iteration 1!
